# FoodVenture
## Inspiration
We are bored and tired of traveling and ending up going to a chain/generic restaurant to eat bland, boring, and inauthentic food.

## What it does
It will allow users to view different countries, their cities, and what specialty food they offer and where to find these dishes.

How we built it
Food Venture is made by a team that consists of a mixture of developers and designers. All members were able to get involved in designing, coding, as well as researching. For the Front-end, we use: Bootstraps framework. The website is construct with HTML, CSS, and Javascript

## Challenges we ran into
As our team is mostly first-time hackathon participants, the passionate fire of wanting to create an extremely awesome website is blown away as we encountered the wall of our own lack of experience.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We pay a lot of attention on how to presents the regional cuisines of each countries the most concise and as clear as possible. We hope that we have done a good job of representing each country's wonderful culinary.

## What we learned
Since we were all pretty new to website development in general, we ran into a lot of problems in the beginning of the project, including agreeing on a concept, learning basic web development skills. We definitely became more fluent in HTML, CSS, and Javascript because of this. This might sound like a cliche but we learned to be better teammates for each other.

## What's next for FoodVenture
Expand our country, city, and cuisine database. Develop a more interactive experience (users can choose/search countries/cities they want to explore) Adding a "Pronunciation" section with audio for users to better learn about the cuisine/culture.
